== History ==
The area name of Yatomi appears in Kamakura period documents, as part of ancient Owari Province. During the Edo period, the area was noted for raising ornamental goldfish. During the Meiji period, the area was organized into villages under Kasai District, Aichi Prefecture, which later became Ama District, Aichi. Yatomi was proclaimed a town on August 26, 1903. The Isewan Typhoon of September 26, 1959 created extensive damage to the area. Efforts to merge Yatomi with the neighboring town of Kanie failed in 2004 over a dispute on the naming of the new entity.
The modern city of Yatomi was founded on April 1, 2006, from the merger between the former town of Yatomi, absorbing the village of Jūshiyama (both from Ama District).
