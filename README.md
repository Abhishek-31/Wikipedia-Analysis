### WIKIPEDIA-ANALYSER

Although data could be parsed by sending to us a XML file that would help in telling the content of the file but an API named Wikipedia is used which is giving the expected data.
For installing you can use following commands :


```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
pip3 install wikipedia
# For installing gensinm you have to use
pip3 install -U gensim
``` 
Now you are good to go. Data could be manually parsed through xml parser or builtin parsers that are known for their optimisation.
LDA is used so as to do topic modelling. Randomly selected topics could be used but parameters have to be tuned accordingly.
