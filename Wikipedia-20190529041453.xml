'''Narendra Damodardas Modi''' ({{IPA-gu|ˈnəɾendrə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː|Hi-NarendraModi.ogg}}; born 17 September 1950) is an Indian politician serving as the [[List of Prime Ministers of India|14th]] and current [[Prime Minister of India]] since 2014. He was the [[Chief Minister of Gujarat|Chief Minister]] of [[Gujarat]] from 2001 to 2014, and is the [[Member of parliament, Lok Sabha|Member of Parliament]] for [[Varanasi (Lok Sabha constituency)|Varanasi]]. Modi is a member of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), and of the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), a [[Hindutva|Hindu nationalist]] volunteer organisation. He is the first prime minister outside of the [[Indian National Congress]] to win two consecutive terms with a full majority, and the second one to complete five years in office after [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Malik |first1=Aman |title=Elections 2019: PM Modi returns with bigger mandate, faces growth challenge |url=https://www.vccircle.com/elections-2019-pm-modi-returns-with-bigger-mandate-faces-growth-challenge/ |accessdate=23 May 2019 |work=VCCircle |date=23 May 2019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born to a Gujarati family in [[Vadnagar]], Modi helped his father sell tea as a child, and has said he later ran his own stall. He was introduced to the RSS at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. Modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an [[arranged marriage]] to [[Jashodaben|Jashodaben Chimanlal]], which he abandoned, and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. Modi travelled around India for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to Gujarat. In 1971 he became a full-time worker for the RSS. During the [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] imposed across the country in 1975, Modi was forced to go into hiding. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985, and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001, due to [[Keshubhai Patel]]'s failing health and poor public image following the [[2001 Gujarat earthquake|earthquake in Bhuj]]. Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the [[2002 Gujarat riots]],{{efn|Sources describing Modi's administration as complicit in the 2002 violence.&lt;ref name="Bobbio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Clash Within" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shani" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Buncombe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot2013" /&gt;}} or otherwise criticised for its handling of it. A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.{{efn|In 2012, a court stated that investigations had found no evidence against Modi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17664751|title=India Gujarat Chief Minister Modi cleared in riots case|publisher=BBC|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220174351/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-17664751|archivedate=20 December 2016|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sit-finds-no-proof-against-modi-says-court/article3300175.ece|title=SIT finds no proof against Modi, says court|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221082846/http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/sit-finds-no-proof-against-modi-says-court/article3300175.ece|archivedate=21 December 2016|last1=Dasgupta|first1=Manas}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16.html|title=Shaking Off the Horror of the Past in India|last=Joseph|first=Manu|date=15 February 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=19 May 2017|issn=0362-4331|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312085254/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/16/world/asia/16iht-letter16.html|archivedate=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty, and education indices in the state.{{efn|Sources stating that Modi has failed to improve human development indices in Gujarat.&lt;ref name="Buncombe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot2013" /&gt;}}

Modi led the BJP in the [[Indian general election, 2014|2014 general election]], which gave the party a majority in the Indian [[lower house]] of parliament, the [[Lok Sabha]], the first time for any single party since 1984. Modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the Indian economy, and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. Modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]]. He began a [[Swachh Bharat mission|high-profile sanitation campaign]], and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. He initiated a controversial [[2016 Indian banknote demonetisation|demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes]]. Described as engineering a political realignment towards [[right-wing politics]], Modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his Hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an [[Social exclusion|exclusionary social]] agenda.{{efn|Sources discussing the controversy surrounding Modi.&lt;ref name="Buncombe"&gt;{{cite news |title=A rebirth dogged by controversy |first=Andrew |last=Buncombe |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-rebirth-dogged-by-controversy-2357157.html |work=The Independent |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=10 October 2012 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024707/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/a-rebirth-dogged-by-controversy-2357157.html |archivedate=25 December 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Menon |first=Kalyani Devaki|title=Everyday Nationalism: Women of the Hindu Right in India |year=2012 |publisher=The University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-2234-0 |page=26 |quote=Yet, months after this violent pogrom against Muslims, the Hindu nationalist chief minister of Gujarat, Narendra Modi, went to the polls and won a resounding victory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mishra |first=Pankaj |title=Perspectives on Modern South Asia: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation|date=April 2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4051-0062-5|page=188|editor-first=Kamala |editor-last=Visweswaran|quote=The chief minister of Gujarat, a young up-and-coming leader of the Hindu nationalists called Narendra Modi, quoted Isaac Newton to explain the killings of Muslims.

== Early life and education ==

Narendra Modi was born on 17 September 1950 to a family of grocers in [[Vadnagar]], [[Mehsana district]], [[Bombay State]] (present-day [[Gujarat]]). He was the third of six children born to Damodardas Mulchand Modi (c. 1915–1989) and Hiraben Modi (born c. 1920).{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=13, 15, 29–30, 74}} Modi's family belonged to the [[Modh]]-[[Ghanchi]]-[[Teli]] (oil-presser) community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-narendra-modi-belongs-to-modh-ghanchi-caste-which-was-added-to-obcs-categories-in-1994-says-gujarat-government-1986389|title=Narendra Modi belongs to Modh-Ghanchi caste, which was added to OBCs categories in 1994, says Gujarat government {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=9 May 2014|work=dna|access-date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161204174201/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-narendra-modi-belongs-to-modh-ghanchi-caste-which-was-added-to-obcs-categories-in-1994-says-gujarat-government-1986389|archivedate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modi-brother-asks-teli-community-to-adopt-modi-prefix-4386125/|title=PM Modi's brother asks Teli community to adopt 'Modi' prefix|date=20 November 2016|work=The Indian Express|access-date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309032700/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-modi-brother-asks-teli-community-to-adopt-modi-prefix-4386125/|archivedate=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Modi-is-a-Teli-Ghanchi-OBC-BJP/articleshow/34084111.cms|title='Modi is a Teli-Ghanchi OBC': BJP – Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002124849/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Modi-is-a-Teli-Ghanchi-OBC-BJP/articleshow/34084111.cms|archivedate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is categorised as an [[Other Backward Class]] by the Indian government.&lt;ref name=" TOI Modh-Ghanchi-Teli"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Modi-is-a-Teli-Ghanchi-OBC-BJP/articleshow/34084111.cms|title='Modi is a Teli-Ghanchi OBC': BJP|work=The Times of India|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=17 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206064221/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Modi-is-a-Teli-Ghanchi-OBC-BJP/articleshow/34084111.cms|archivedate=6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/the-office-of-prime-minister-a-largely-north-indian-upper-caste-hindu-affair-114050700846_1.html|title=The office of Prime Minister: A largely north Indian upper-caste, Hindu affair|last=Ghai|first=Rajat|date=7 May 2014|work=Business Standard India|access-date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619200229/http://www.business-standard.com/article/opinion/the-office-of-prime-minister-a-largely-north-indian-upper-caste-hindu-affair-114050700846_1.html|archivedate=19 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Modi helped his father sell tea at the [[Vadnagar railway station]], and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oneindia.com/international/i-have-special-association-with-tea-modi-tells-lankan-tamils-2433622.html|title='I have a special association with tea', Modi tells Lankan Tamils|work=www.oneindia.com|access-date=19 May 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512103929/http://www.oneindia.com/international/i-have-special-association-with-tea-modi-tells-lankan-tamils-2433622.html|archivedate=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi completed his [[Higher Secondary Examination|higher secondary education]] in Vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre.&lt;ref name="Jose Caravan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned?page=1,1|title=The Emperor Uncrowned|last=Jose|first=Vinod K.|date=1 March 2012|work=The Caravan|pages=2–4|authorlink=Vinod Jose|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111220259/http://www.caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned?page=1,1|archivedate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this.{{sfn|Marino|2014|p=16}} Modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.{{sfn|Mukhopadhyay|2013|p=82}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newkerala.com/news/2014/fullnews-24257.html |title=Modi's life dominates publishing space (Election Special) |work=New Kerala |date=14 March 2014 |accessdate=4 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315130016/http://www.newkerala.com/news/2014/fullnews-24257.html |archivedate=15 March 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When eight years old, Modi discovered the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and began attending its local ''shakhas'' (training sessions). There, Modi met [[Lakshmanrao Inamdar]], popularly known as Vakil Saheb, who inducted him as a ''balswayamsevak'' (junior cadet) in the RSS and became his political mentor.{{sfn|Marino|2014 |p=24}} While Modi was training with the RSS, he also met Vasant Gajendragadkar and Nathalal Jaghda, [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]] leaders who were founding members of the BJP's Gujarat unit in 1980.&lt;ref name="Pathak TNN" /&gt;

Also in Narendra Modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a [[betrothal]] to a girl, Jashodaben Chimanlal, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers.&lt;ref name=gowen1&gt;{{citation|author=Annie Gowen|publisher=The Washington Post|date= 25 January 2015|title=Abandoned as a child bride, wife of Narendra Modi hopes he calls|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/abandoned-as-a-child-bride-indias-first-lady-still-hopes-her-husband-will-call/2015/01/25/3509dac5-5ac1-49e3-8b44-7d92e027c9ec_story.html}} Quote: "The wife, Jashodaben Chimanlal Modi, is a retired teacher who lives in a small town in Modi’s home state of Gujarat ...

== Early political career ==
In June 1975, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] declared a [[The Emergency (India)|state of emergency]] in India which lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "The Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned.{{sfn|Guha|2008|p=493–494}}{{sfn|Kochanek|Hardgrave|2007|p=205}} Modi was appointed general secretary of the "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee coordinating opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was banned.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=36–40}} Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. He became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to Delhi and organising demonstrations.{{sfn|Marino|2014|p=43}}{{sfn|Mukhopadhyay|2013|p=150}} Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43}} During this period, Modi wrote a book in [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], ''Sangharsh Ma Gujarat'' (''In The Struggles of Gujarat''), describing events during the Emergency.&lt;ref name="Aakar-PoetModi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Patel |first=Aakar |title=The poetic side of Narendra Modi |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131222/commentary-columnists/commentary/poetic-side-narendra-modi |website=Deccan Chronicle |accessdate=23 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524050207/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131222/commentary-columnists/commentary/poetic-side-narendra-modi |archivedate=24 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujarat-not-enamoured-by-poet-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/757261.cms|title=Gujarat not enamoured by poet Narendra Modi|work=[[The Times of India]]|date=28 June 2004|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023124625/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Gujarat-not-enamoured-by-poet-Narendra-Modi/articleshow/757261.cms|archivedate=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist [[George Fernandes]], as well as several other national political figures.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43, 46–50}} In his travels during the Emergency, Modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a [[Sikh]].{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=38–43}}

Modi became an RSS ''sambhag pracharak'' (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing RSS activities in the areas of [[Surat]] and [[Vadodara]], and in 1979 he went to work for the RSS in Delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the RSS's version of the history of the Emergency.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=45–48}} He returned to Gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the RSS to the BJP in 1985.&lt;ref name="Pathak TNN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Modis-meteoric-rise/articleshow/1459210533.cms?referral=PM|title=Modi's meteoric rise |work=The Times of India |date=2 October 2001 |last=Pathak |first=Anil |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Modi helped organise the BJP's campaign in the Ahmedabad municipal election, which the BJP won comfortably; Modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers.{{sfn|Marino|2014|pp=54–57}} After [[L.

Modi rose within the party and was named a member of the BJP's National Election Committee in 1990, helping organise [[L. K.

=== Development debate ===
[[File:Modi at GNLU.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Modi speaking at flower-decked podium|Modi addressing graduates of the [[Gujarat National Law University]] in 2012.]]
A contentious debate surrounds the assessment of Gujarat's economic development during Modi's tenure as chief minister.&lt;ref name="Basu 2014" /&gt; The state's GDP growth rate averaged 10% during Modi's tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole.&lt;ref name="Modi-nomics"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schöttli|first1=Jivanta|last2=Pauli|first2=Markus|title=Modi-nomics and the politics of institutional change in the Indian economy|journal=Journal of Asian Public Policy|date=2016|volume=9|issue=2|pages=154–169|doi=10.1080/17516234.2016.1165332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before Modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during Modi's tenure.&lt;ref name="Ghatak"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghatak|first1=Maitreesh|last2=Roy|first2=Sanchari|title=Did Gujarat's Growth Rate Accelerate under Modi?|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=12 April 2014|volume=49|issue=15|pages=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Modi, Gujarat topped the [[World Bank]]'s "ease of doing business" rankings among Indian states for two consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gujarat tops ease of doing business ranking among states – The Economic Times on Mobile|url = http://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/indicators/gujarat-tops-ease-of-doing-business-ranking-among-states/articleshow/48964454.cms|accessdate = 16 September 2015|first = Times Internet|last = Limited|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180110175758/https://m.economictimes.com/news/economy/indicators/gujarat-tops-ease-of-doing-business-ranking-among-states/articleshow/48964454.cms|archive-date = 10 January 2018|dead-url = no|df = dmy-all|date = 15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gujarat was ranked first among Indian states for "economic freedom" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states.&lt;ref name="Modi-nomics" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gujarat tops list of economically-free states|url = http://m.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-top-ranked-state-in-terms-of-economic-freedom-study/article1-1196878.aspx|website =hindustantimes.com/|accessdate = 16 September 2015|date = 19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism.&lt;ref name="Bobbio" /&gt; Tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in Gujarat than in other states, as was land. Modi's policies to make Gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of [[Special Economic Zones]], where labour laws were greatly weakened.&lt;ref name="India Review" /&gt;

Despite its growth rate, Gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during Modi's tenure. In 2013, Gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. Nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the "alarming" category on the [[India State Hunger Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Ghanshyam |title=Politics of Governance: A Study of Gujarat |journal=Studies in Indian Politics |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=June 2013 |pages=65–77 |doi=10.1177/2321023013482788}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hariss 2015" /&gt; A study by [[UNICEF]] and the Indian government found that Gujarat under Modi had a poor record with respect to [[immunisation]] in children.&lt;ref name="Economist 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sparing Mr Modi's blushes|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21656239-missing-data-should-embarrass-prime-minister-sparing-mr-modis-blushes|accessdate=9 November 2016|date=27 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130055250/http://www.economist.com/news/asia/21656239-missing-data-should-embarrass-prime-minister-sparing-mr-modis-blushes|archivedate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the decade from 2001 to 2011, Gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 Indian states.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Model" /&gt; It showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Model" /&gt; With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most Indian states.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Model" /&gt; The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, [[Dalit]]s, and [[Adivasi]]s, and generally increased social inequalities.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Model" /&gt; Development in Gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. In 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 Indian states in the [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |authorlink=Christophe Jaffrelot |title=Gujarat Elections: The Sub-Text of Modi's 'Hattrick'—High Tech Populism and the 'Neo-middle Class' |journal=Studies in Indian Politics |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=June 2013 |pages=79–95 |doi= 10.1177/2321023013482789}}{{Cite journal |url=http://inp.sagepub.com/content/1/1/79.abstract?rss=1 |title=Gujarat Elections: The Sub-Text of Modi's 'Hattrick'—High Tech Populism and the 'Neo-middle Class' |journal=Studies in Indian Politics |volume=1 |pages=79–95 |accessdate=12 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023124526/http://inp.sagepub.com/content/1/1/79.abstract?rss=1 |archivedate=23 October 2015  |doi=10.1177/2321023013482789 |year=2013 |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.&lt;ref name="Gujarat Model" /&gt;

=== Final years ===

{{Further|2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly election}}
Despite the BJP's shift away from explicit Hindutva, Modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of Hindu nationalism. Modi only attended Hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with Hindu religious leaders. During his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by Muslim leaders.&lt;ref name="India Review" /&gt; He did, however, maintain relations with [[Dawoodi Bohra]].&lt;ref name="India Review" /&gt; His campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to Afzal Guru and the [[Death of Sohrabuddin Sheikh|killing of Sohrabuddin Sheikh]]. The BJP did not nominate any Muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012.&lt;ref name="India Review" /&gt; During the 2012 campaign, Modi attempted to identify himself with the state of Gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by Indira Gandhi during the Emergency, and projected himself as protecting Gujarat against persecution by the rest of India.&lt;ref name="India Review" /&gt;

While campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, Modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people,&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot T&amp;NM" /&gt; something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. In the 2012 Gujarat Legislative Assembly elections, Modi won the constituency of Maninagar by 86,373 votes over Shweta Bhatt, the INC candidate and wife of [[Sanjiv Bhatt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=NDTV |title=Big win for Narendra Modi, defeats Shweta Bhatt by huge margin |agency=Press Trust of India |date=20 December 2012 |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/assembly-polls/big-win-for-narendra-modi-defeats-shweta-bhatt-by-huge-margin-307772anan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJP won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=198 |title=Pogrom in Gujarat: Hindu Nationalism and Anti-Muslim Violence in India |first=Parvis |last=Ghassem-fachandi |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-691-15177-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p5s8hooZfekC&amp;pg=PA198 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106133029/https://books.google.com/books?id=p5s8hooZfekC&amp;pg=PA198 |archivedate=6 January 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in Gujarat since 1995).&lt;ref name="SL-20121220"&gt;1. {{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_action-continues-narendra-modi-makes-lotus-bloom-again-in-gujarat_1779889 |title=Action continues: Narendra Modi makes lotus bloom again in Gujarat |work=DNA India |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=17 April 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223061750/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_action-continues-narendra-modi-makes-lotus-bloom-again-in-gujarat_1779889 |archivedate=23 December 2012  }}&lt;br /&gt;2. {{cite news |url=http://www.saharasamay.com/nation-news/676520489/gujarat-elections-results-live-narendra-modi-bjp-congress-bharat.html |title=Gujarat results 2012 Live :Modi's claim for PM's post gets stronger |work=Samay Live |date=20 December 2012 |accessdate=21 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102154044/http://www.saharasamay.com/nation-news/676520489/gujarat-elections-results-live-narendra-modi-bjp-congress-bharat.html |archivedate=2 January 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Modi government launched investigations by the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] against numerous civil society organizations and foreign non-governmental organizations in the first year of the administration. The investigations, on the grounds that these organizations were slowing economic growth, was criticized as a witchhunt.

Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding INC government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations.&lt;ref name="Hall 2015" /&gt; Modi continued Manmohan Singh's policy of "multi-alignment."&lt;ref name="Hall 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=Ian|title=Multialignment and Indian Foreign Policy under Narendra Modi|journal=The Round Table|date=2016|doi=10.1080/00358533.2016.1180760|volume=105|issue=3|pages=271–286}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the Indian economy from several sources, especially in East Asia, with the use of slogans such as "Make in India" and "Digital India".&lt;ref name="Hall 2016" /&gt; The government also tried to improve relations with Islamic nations in the Middle East, such as Bahrain, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as with Israel.&lt;ref name="Hall 2016" /&gt;

During the first few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the [[BRICS]], [[ASEAN]], and [[G20]] summits.&lt;ref name="Hall 2015" /&gt; One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid.&lt;ref name="Mocko"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mocko|first1=Anne|last2=Penjore|first2=Dorji|title=Nepal and Bhutan in 2014|journal=Asian Survey|date=2015|volume=55|issue=1|pages=75–81|doi=10.1525/AS.2015.55.1.75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country.&lt;ref name="Pant 2014" /&gt; While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Pant 2014" /&gt;

In 2015, the Indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with Bangladesh about the [[India–Bangladesh enclaves]], which had been initiated by the government of Manmohan Singh.&lt;ref name="Ronojoy" /&gt; Modi's administration gave renewed attention to India's "Look East Policy", instituted in 1991. The policy was renamed the "Act East Policy", and involved directing Indian foreign policy towards [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref name="Hall 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Downie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downie|first1=Edmund|title=Manipur and India's 'Act East' Policy|journal=The Diplomat|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with [[Myanmar]], through the state of [[Manipur]]. This represented a break with India's historic engagement with Myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.&lt;ref name="Downie" /&gt;

=== Defence policy ===

The BJP election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into India in the Northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. The Modi government issued a notification allowing Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to legalise their residency in India. The government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several Assamese organisations.&lt;ref name="Northeast" /&gt;

The Modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the [[National Socialist Council of Nagaland]] (NSCM), which was announced in August 2015. The [[Naga people|Naga]] insurgency in northeast India had begun in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Northeast"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Amarjeet|title=Narendra Modi and Northeast India: development, insurgency and illegal migration|journal=Journal of Asian Public Policy|date=2016|volume=9|issue=2|pages=112–127|doi=10.1080/17516234.2016.1165313}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sinha&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sinha|first1=Amitabh|last2=Swami|first2=Praveen|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/simply-put-towards-accord-step-by-step/|title=Towards the Govt-Naga peace accord: Everything you need to know|publisher=The Indian Express|date=4 August 2015|accessdate=30 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128123558/http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/simply-put-towards-accord-step-by-step/|archivedate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSCM and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed.&lt;ref name=Sinha /&gt; In 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the Khaplang faction of the NSCM (NSCM-K). The NSCM-K responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people.&lt;ref name="Northeast" /&gt; The Modi government carried out a raid across the border with Myanmar as a result, and labelled the NSCM-K a terrorist organisation.&lt;ref name="Northeast" /&gt;

Modi promised to be "tough on Pakistan" during his election campaign, and repeatedly stated that Pakistan was an [[Pakistan and state-sponsored terrorism|exporter of terrorism]].&lt;ref name="Reversing roles"&gt;{{cite news |title=Reversing roles |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2016/10/06/reversing-roles?zid=306&amp;ah=1b164dbd43b0cb27ba0d4c3b12a5e227 |accessdate=8 April 2019 |work=The Economist |date=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tie0916&gt;{{cite news |title=PM slams Pakistan on terror: 10 quotes from Narendra Modi's speech in Kozhikode |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-narendra-modi-kozhikode-kerala-speech-bjp-pakistan-uri-attack-3048273 |work=[[The Indian Express]] |date=24 September 2016 |accessdate=17 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119141653/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/pm-narendra-modi-kozhikode-kerala-speech-bjp-pakistan-uri-attack-3048273/ |archivedate=19 November 2016  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://m.timesofindia.com/india/Pakistan-terrorism-PM-Narendra-Modi-G20-Summit-China/articleshow/54016423.cms |title=One nation in South Asia spreading terrorism: PM Modi at G20 Summit |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=5 September 2016 |accessdate=17 February 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310205635/http://m.timesofindia.com/india/Pakistan-terrorism-PM-Narendra-Modi-G20-Summit-China/articleshow/54016423.cms |archivedate=10 March 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September 2016, the Indian Army stated that it had conducted a [[surgical strike]] on terror launchpads in [[Azad Kashmir]].

=== Environmental policy ===
[[File:Prime Minister Narendra Modi at India Pavilion in Paris during COP21 (23193999974).jpg|thumb|Modi (right) at [[CoP21 Climate Conference]], in Paris, announcing the founding of an International [[Solar Alliance]] (ISA). November 2015.]]
In naming his cabinet, Modi renamed the "Ministry of Environment and Forests" the "Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change."&lt;ref name="Kothari"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kothari|first1=Ashish|title=A Hundred Days Closer to Ecological and Social Suicide|journal=Economic &amp; Political Weekly|date=27 September 2014|volume=49|issue=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%.&lt;ref name="Kothari" /&gt; The new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. These included no longer requiring clearance from the [[National Board for Wildlife]] for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received.&lt;ref name="Ruparelia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kothari" /&gt; The government also tried to reconstitute the Wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="Kothari" /&gt;

Modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating.&lt;ref name="Ruparelia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Barry|first1=Ellen|last2=Bagri|first2=Neha Thirani|title=Narendra Modi, Favoring Growth in India, Pares Back Environmental Rules|work=The New York Times|date=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries.&lt;ref name="Kothari" /&gt; The changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;

Under the UPA government that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of [[Genetically modified food|Genetically Modified (GM) crops]] had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods.&lt;ref name="GM crops"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Sanjay|title=India eases stance on GM crop trials|journal=Nature|date=14 May 2015|volume=521|issue=7551|pages=138–139|bibcode=2015Natur.521..138K|doi=10.1038/521138a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted.&lt;ref name="GM crops" /&gt; The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group [[Greenpeace]], citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops.&lt;ref name="GM crops" /&gt;

=== Personal life ===
In accordance with Ghanchi tradition, Modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. He was engaged at age 13 to [[Jashodaben]], marrying her when he was 18.
